**sprint3_motorOnePhotoTransistor, sprint3_motorTwoPhotoTransistor** == phototransistor code without camera

**sprint3_phototransistorsWithCamera** == Combines two phototransistors with camera code

This is successful left wall following from end of Monday == **phototransistor_withCamera_andBeacons**

This combines left wall following with multi GET/POST server code == **leftwallAndServer_multi**

This combines left wall following with single GET/POST server code == **leftwallAndServer_single**
